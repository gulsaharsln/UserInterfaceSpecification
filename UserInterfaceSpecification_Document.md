# User Management Module Interface Specification

## Core Functionalities

This document serves as a blueprint for developing the User Management Module, which is a critical component of our system. It details the specifications for the primary interface elements, their behaviors, and the initial content presentation.

## Interface Elements Breakdown

### Command Bar
- **New User Button**: Triggers the process to input details for a new user.
- **Disabled User Filter**: A checkbox for showing or hiding users who are not currently active.

### Users Overview Grid
- **Headers**: Display categories such as 'ID', 'User Name', 'Email', and 'Enabled' status.
- **Selection**: Each user row is interactive and can be selected to view more details.

### User Information Form
- **Data Fields**: Include areas to enter 'Username', 'Display Name', 'Phone', 'Email'.
- **Roles Dropdown**: Allows for assigning roles such as 'Guest', 'Admin', 'SuperAdmin'.
- **Enable Checkbox**: A checkbox to activate or deactivate a user's account.
- **Save User Button**: Located at the top, this button confirms and saves the user data to the database.


## Behavior Specifications

### On Initial Load
- The User Listing Table should show an empty state with a message indicating no current users if none exist.
- The User Detail Entry Section should be ready to accept new user information with all fields in a blank state.

### User Interaction
- Selecting a user from the User Listing Table loads their information into the User Detail Entry Section for review or changes.
- The 'New User Button' clears the User Detail Entry Section for the addition of a new user.
- The 'Disabled User Filter' toggles the list to either display or hide users marked as inactive.

### Data Interaction
- Upon clicking the 'Save User Button', the system performs data validation. If the data is correct, it updates the user list or adds a new user as appropriate.
- Clear error messages are displayed next to the relevant fields if there is an issue with the data provided.

## Starting View

- The Command Toolbar is visible with action items for user creation and filtering.
- An informative placeholder is shown in the User Listing Table when no users are available.
- The User Detail Entry Section is presented as a blank form, inviting input for new user information.

## Implementation Notes

- The design must be responsive, ensuring usability across different devices and screen sizes.
- Accessibility guidelines must be followed to provide an accessible interface.
- Real-time data refreshing techniques should be employed to avoid full page reloads.
- User feedback should be immediate and informative, especially after save operations.
